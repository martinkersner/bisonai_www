      Everybody has a <strong>super computer in their pocket</strong>. Take advantage of that! With solutions from Bisonai you can perform model inference or train personalized models using mobile devices only.

      <strong>User's data are kept safe</strong> in their phones, not transferred to remote servers. By performing model inference on mobile device only, we are able to fully remove the need to serve models on remote servers and therefore <strong>decrease the cost, complexity and latency</strong> of your service. Today's mobile devices can perform complex calculations in terms of milliseconds and with clever optimization we can support older devices as well.
